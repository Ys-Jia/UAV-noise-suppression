An UAV Wireless Communication Noise Suppression Method Based on OFDM Modulation and Demodulation

## Abstract

In view of the problem that the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication link is vulnerable to strong electromagnetic pulse generated by lightning or high-voltage transmission lines in the complex electromagnetic environment, the influence of the electromagnetic pulse generated by the high-voltage transmission line of the EFT electromagnetic pulse and the surge electromagnetic pulse on wireless communication link are analyzed in this paper. When those electromagnetic pulse's noise field strength is 500 V/m, the bit-error-rate of the communication link is increased to 45.39%, 45.39%, and 46.10%, respectively, indicating that surge pulse has the strongest influence on the communication link. Therefore, a UAV noise suppression method based on the principle of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation and demodulation and dual antenna design has been proposed in this paper. This method is used to filter out electromagnetic impulse noise after wireless signal reception, and then demodulate to achieve the goal of noise suppression. Applying the method to a certain type of UAV based on OFDM modulation and demodulation, and theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively suppress the electromagnetic pulse generated by high-voltage transmission lines, EFT electromagnetic pulse, surge electromagnetic pulse, the bit-error-rate dropped to 0.005597%, 0.004531%, 0.005597%, respectively.
